> “We aren’t really bad at estimating. What we are really bad at is enumerating all the assumptions that lie behind our estimates.”

— Paul Rook (great quote from the book)

I think risk management isn’t a super popular theme in the software community, but after reading this, I understand its importance much better and wanted to share it.

The book is relatively short - about 150 pages - but filled with lots of ideas and actionable suggestions to rethink how we approach risk in software projects.

The prose is fun and easy to read, and even though it was written in 2003, it feels like it could’ve come out yesterday.
