Howdy!

I'm currently working as a Software Development Engineer II at Amazon in Tokyo, Japan.

In my (not so long yet) career, I've worked on a variety of projects, including:

- Developing an app for COVID-19 vaccinations
- Improving how an edge computing provider distributes configurations across hundreds of servers
- Helping to launch Amazon Furusato in Japan

My academic background is in Electronics Engineering, so I also enjoy playing around with hardware.

I'm interested in various technical topics such as Cloud Computing, Operating Systems, Networking, and Systems Programming.

Learning how things work under the hood is always fascinating to me.

I love experimenting with technologies, both old and new, and you can find most of my projects on my GitHub profile.

My hobbies include learning new languages and skills, as well as traveling around!
