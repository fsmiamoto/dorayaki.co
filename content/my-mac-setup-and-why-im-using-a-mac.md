It was not long ago where I was a heavy Linux-based user but recently I'm more and more switching to macOS.

But over the years, I definitely lost that energy I had in my younger days to just spend an hour figuring out
how to fix the most basic things in a modern computer.

While there's is some truth to saying that Linux doesn't "just works" - I would not give a Linux machine to my Mom for example -
I still feel like that at least as a software developer, debugging and fixing things made a much stronger engineer.

While the distro I've used the most - Arch Linux btw - doesn't require you to go to the level of compiling the Kernel itself,
still you have to setup things like networking, system clock, partitions and everything by yourself.

Of course there's tons of guides and information about it, but still it forces you to really understand how the machine works
and to some degree that is a great way of "opening up the hood" and realizing that everything is just software.

Software that very well could've been written by yourself, and feeling like you can just tweak your machine to that level
is definitely a great feeling.

After you get your machine running, you might also fall into the rabbit hole of "ricing" your setup to make it look pretty and cool to the other kids.

I definitely spend more time on this than I'd like to admit but again I think that gave me such a strong Linux background that I just don't
see in most software developers today.

### Why macOS then?

While my life changes since I've started using Linux definitely contribute to my decision to move to macOS, I think the biggest one
to me is that I'd like to

But I think the major thing that led me to macOS was the fact that I can't really pick the platform I use at my workplace.

Because of that, I naturally have to adapt my style and shortcuts to function properly in that environment.

Whenever I wanted a nice config for something, I usually had to do it twice: once on Linux and then again for macOS.

Of course, given the shared Unix heritage of both systems, a lot of things can be shared but they are usually slightly different
and I end up having to fix it in the end.
