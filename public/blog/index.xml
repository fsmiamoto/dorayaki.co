      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the end of 2021 just around the corner, I took the time to reflect about some of the
things I&amp;rsquo;ve deliberately practiced in the last couple of years and one of them definitely
stands out: Learning how to touch type properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I&amp;rsquo;ve played around with computers pretty much my entire life, my typing skills
were not really great (about 40 WPM at best) back in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was during a Computer Architecture class where I observed a colleague
with really great typing skills and asked him about it. He mentioned that he practiced
using a website called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.typingclub.com/&#34;&gt;TypingClub&lt;/a&gt;
and by looking at him typing the results really showed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve just finished my class of Embedded Systems in my university and
I have to say, it was an awesome experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a guy that really likes low level stuff, understanding how a micro controller
works internally to get to the point of running an actual Real Time Operating System (RTOS)
was really enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go through some of things you can learn while studying Embedded Systems :D&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;bare-metal&#34;&gt;Bare Metal?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have to start somewhere and that&amp;rsquo;s bare metal, running code without
an actual operating system behind it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
